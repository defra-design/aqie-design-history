## Research goals from sprint one

* Is postcode look-up sufficient for looking up air quality?
* DAQI: do participants understand the DAQI score/levels as relevant to them?​
* Do people read and understand the health advice? Do they regard it as relevant to them?
* Do people engage with the measurement stations (location, readings) and do they give credibility to the DAQI score?​
* Do users come away appreciating that poor AQ poses a health risk?​

## Research findings

### What worked well

Most of the participants commented that the prototype was in keeping with many government websites, it was noted that:

* the site is credible and easy to use
* the location search did not present participants with any friction and in this round everyone entered a postcode without prompts
* the site content was clear, straight forward and easy to understand
* The health information was engaging and even showed signs of overturning some air quality myths and creating interest in behavioural change

### What needs work

Whilst the beginning of the user’s journey tested well, once they arrived at a forecast location, it was noted: 

* scientific language, especially around pollutant names and measures, presented a barrier to participants
* monitoring stations and how data is being collected isn't of high interest and can lead to key information being completely ignored (The names in the prototype  were fictional and so it could be percieved that particpants didn't/couldn't relate to these)
* the location of the pollutant information under related content was overlooked

## What we focussed on in sprint two

As a team, in Sprint two, we agreed the main points to focus on were:  

* The flow of the content; as users were put off reading the ‘related content’ perhaps due to the positioning and the use of scientific terms
* By promoting pollutant measurements versus monitoring sites would they increase engagement?
* Using nearby location names for the monitoring sites would they make these more relatable?

## Air quality forecast location

![Air quality forecast location](../../images/sprint-two/location.png "")

We updated this page to make it easier for users to learn about the air quality in their area by reorganising the hierarchy and putting it all on one page rather than branching the pollutants off under ‘related content’. 

## Flow of content

We adapted the headings to show a logical flow that the user would follow. 

### 'The air pollution forecast for today is moderate'

The level of air pollution is what users all users seem interested in after entering their location.

### 'Advice for moderate levels of air pollution'

Next, we tell the users what this level of air pollution means for them and highlighting advice for those at risk who may have health concerns.

### 'How air pollutants can affect your health’

Next, we went deeper into how the individual pollutants can affect the user’s health. This was the material that was previously in the right hand side of the page under ‘related content’. We are hoping that the heading of this may encourage users to select the individual pollutants to find out more. In previous research, they are often put off reading further as the scientific terms make them think they won’t understand it.

### ‘Air pollutants monitored nearby’

We aimed to make this element more engaging, firstly by introducing the pollutant measurments to the page for each station. Secondly by adding in 2 new columns of ‘trend’ and ‘rising’. We borrowed this concept from the Check for flooding service. We thought that this information would give the paticpants more context to the measurements rather than just displaying an aritary number.

We also have a working hypothesis that we would only display monitoring sites that are within a certian distance for example, 75 miles and up to a maximum of 3.

## Tooltips

![Tooltips](../../images/sprint-two/tooltips.png "")

From previous user research, the information in the data table has proven to be hard to understand for most users. We were struggling to think of a way to explain some of the columns without making the design too busy. Again, looking at the Check for flooding service, we noticed they used tooltips in a very similar data table to ours. We had a productive chat with the interaction and content designer from the service who walked through their user research and accessibility findings. The use of tooltips had been mentioned by users during our alpha user research. This made us comfortable in trying them in the iteration for sprint two. 

## Pollutant details page

![Pollutant details page](../../images/sprint-two/pollutant-details.png "")

The pollutant pages generally tested well during the first sprint. Participants struggled with the content of the pollutant banding table so we removed this from each page. 
Io improve the flow and ensure consistency, we made sure they followed a set format: 

* what is the pollutant
* what sources does it come from
* what are the short exposure term health effects
* what are the long term exposure health effects
