## Research goals from sprint 15


* Has the changes to the title improved users understanding of the area the forecast location covers?
* Improve visibilty for signing up to alerts within the forecast location
* Simplifying alert choices—perhaps users don’t need to select the type of alert they receive?

## Research findings

### What worked well

In this round of research, we found:

* the tweaks we've made to signpost timeframes—DAQI now, forecast for the next few days, historical data from the past year, and current readings from monitoring stations—seem to be making it easier for people to keep track of timeframes
* the change to the page title to make the location clearer seems to be working well
* alerts sign up is very smooth, click through to view alerts is positively received


### What needs work

What we are continuing to find:

* The historical data in table format is difficult for users to understand and will need further work post-alerts.
* The concept of highlighting the main pollutant in an area is sparking interest but requires more work to drive engagement.
* Participants remain confused by 'Current air pollution levels nearby', especially when the selected stations are far from the forecast location.
* Participants are very keen on having more detailed information for self-protection.
* Participants don’t understand why the alert is coming from a station so far away.
* Participants are confused by the term 'Legal Limit'.

Some of these issues should be addressed as we refine the messaging around threshold breach alerts. 

Later, we need to consider how to make historical data more engaging, particularly for users in a 'snacking' mindset, by addressing needs such as:

* Is my air quality ever bad?
* Do I need to worry about my air quality?
* Is it getting better or worse?


## What we focused on in sprint 16

In this prototype iteration, we didn't make any major changes.

We set the forecast to a 'green' scenario to observe how a 'good' forecast impacts user interest and engagement in signing up for alerts.
