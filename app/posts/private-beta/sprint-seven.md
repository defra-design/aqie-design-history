## Research goals from sprint 6

This research was conducted with a mix of participants living in rural and urban areas of Northern Ireland.

We focussed on testing our changes to the forecast, including:
* how the Northern Ireland participants managed the search function
* Today, Tomorrow and Outlook tabs
* only displaying the health advice for the highest reading
* Daily Air Quality Index (DAQI) without numbers  
* the changed position of the pollutant summaries and click-through links

We also tested how the tabulated monitoring stations were viewed and understood.


## Research findings

### What worked well

In this round of research, we found:

* participants all managed to find the location they wanted to search for in Northern Ireland
* the new style DAQI scale was understood well
* users all understood the dual forecast 
* the messaging in the prototype is understood
* people are making the connection between poor air quality and at risk individuals


### What needs work

This prototype tested very well and there werenâ€™t any major failings. However, we need to do some more ideation around:
* how to engage users around the localised measurements
* how we can use historical data to help engage and improve the air quality messaging
* can we introduce other features, such as seasonal air quality information



## What we focused on in sprint 7

As a team, in sprint 7, we agreed the main points to focus on were:  

* adding a scale to indicate the full extent of the daily air quality index
* removing the 5 day forecast from the tabs and having a static table containing the 4 day forecast
* putting the UK forecast into the tab component
