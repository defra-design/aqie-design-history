## Research goals from sprint 6

This research was conducted with a mix of participants living in rural and urban areas of Northern Ireland.

We focussed on testing our changes to the forecast, including:
* how the Northern Ireland participants managed the search function
* Today, Tomorrow and Outlook tabs
* only displaying the health advice for the highest reading
* Daily Air Quality Index (DAQI) without numbers  
* the changed position of the pollutant summaries and click-through links

We also tested how the tabulated monitoring stations were viewed and understood.


## Research findings

### What worked well

In this round of research, we found:

* all the participants managed to find the location they wanted to search for in Northern Ireland
* the new style DAQI scale was understood well
* users all understood the dual forecast 
* the messaging in the prototype is understood
* people are making the connection between poor air quality and at risk individuals


### What needs work

This prototype tested very well and there weren’t any major failings. However, we need to do some more ideation around:
* how to engage users around the localised measurements
* how we can use historical data to help engage and improve the air quality messaging
* can we introduce other features, such as seasonal air quality information



## What we focused on in sprint 7

As a team, in sprint 7, we agreed the main points to focus on were:  

* only showing the nearest monitoring area
* displaying a chart with the past 24 hours of pollutant data

### Only showing the nearest monitoring area

Due to the automatic urban and rural network (AURN) monitoring sites being spread widely across the country, it’s unusual for a user to have multiple relevant monitoring areas nearby. Therefore, instead of displaying information for their nearest 3 monitoring areas, we only focused on the closest area.

### displaying a chart with the past 24 hours of pollutant data

We wanted to start displaying some of the historical data that we have access to in a way that could help users understand the main pollutants in their area better. This could help give context to the pollutant levels throughout the day and potentially help users think about what may be causing them to rise or fall and therefore engage more with the concept of air quality.
