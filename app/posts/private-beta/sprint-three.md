## Research goals from sprint two

* Do participants understand the DAQI reading as relevant to them?
* Do participants read and understand the health advice?
* Do participants engage with the measurements in the table? relevant to them?
* Do people engage with the measurement stations (location, readings) and do they give credibility to the DAQI score?â€‹
* Do participants engage and understand the pollutant information and the health impacts of specific pollutants and links to their own behaviour? 

## Research findings

### What worked well


Overall, our team observed improved participant engagement compared to the previous iteration. We noted that:

* participants scrolled down the entirety of the page, despite the length of it
* there was increased engagement with the trend and levels of pollutants in the tables
* the recognisable measuring station names provoked curiosity and commentary 

### What needs work

Whilst we had increased particpant engament from sprint one, it was agreed that we needed to improve:

* participants are still not clicking through to deeper pollutant content without prompts
* articipants are still put off by the scientific names of the pollutants
* the details component with differing levels health information was not being accessed
* mobile optimisation

## What we focussed on in sprint three

As a team, in Sprint three, we agreed the main points to focus on were:  

* adjusting the content heirarchy, whilst bringing more of the health information to the fore
* exploring ways of increasing engagement with the pollutant details
* optimising the content and layouts for tablet and mobile





## Content heirarchy and mobile optimisation

### Health advice

We swapped the health advice for the general population to be above the advice for people at risk. 


### Pollutant details

In order to improve user engement with hte pollutant details we add a teaset paragraph to each pollutant. 


### Tablet and mobile optimisation

We refined the display of data within the table, accomodating the smaller widths available on tablets such as the iPad Air.

At the mobile breakpoint we made the table responsive, hiding the pollutant header and applying a 100% width to the pollutant title for example 'Ozone'. This forced the remaining columns 'Latest', 'Trend' and 'Level'to flow underneath.
