## Research goals from sprint 2

* Do participants understand the DAQI reading as relevant to them?
* Do participants read and understand the health advice?
* Do participants engage with the measurements in the table? relevant to them?
* Do people engage with the measurement stations (location, readings) and do they give credibility to the DAQI score?â€‹
* Do participants engage and understand the pollutant information and the health impacts of specific pollutants and links to their own behaviour? 

## Research findings

### What worked well

Overall, our team observed improved participant engagement compared to the previous iteration. We noted that:

* participants scrolled down the whole page, despite the length of it
* there was increased engagement with the trend and levels of pollutants in the tables
* the recognisable measuring station names provoked curiosity and commentary 

### What needs work

Whilst we had increased participant engagement from sprint one, it was agreed that we needed to improve:

* participants clicking through to deeper pollutant content without prompts
* participants not being put off by the scientific names of the pollutants
* the details component with differing levels of health information being accessed
* mobile optimisation

## What we focussed on in sprint 3

As a team, we agreed the main points to focus on were:  

* adjusting the content hierarchy and making the health information more prominent
* increasing participant engagement with the pollutant details
* optimising the content and layouts for tablet and mobile





## Content hierarchy and mobile optimisation

### Health advice

We adjusted the heading for this section and swapped the health advice for the 'general population' to be above the advice for 'people at risk'. 


### Pollutant details

In order to improve user engagement we added some microcopy below each pollutant. Our hypothesis is that this could encourage the participant's curiosity and would lead to them clicking on each pollutant to find out more. 


### Tablet and mobile optimisation

We refined the display of data within the table, accommodating the smaller widths available on tablets such as the iPad Air.

At the mobile breakpoint, we made the table responsive, hiding the pollutant header and applying a 100% width to the pollutant title for example 'Ozone'. This forced the remaining columns 'Latest', 'Trend' and 'Level'to flow underneath.
