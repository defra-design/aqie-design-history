## Research goals from sprint 8

This research was conducted with a mix of participants living in the South West of England.

We focussed on testing: 
* a 24 hour view of historical local air pollutant levels
* using charts rather than a table to see if the visual approach worked better
* removing the tooltips that explaining elements of the tables and putting the content ‘inline’ instead
* displaying data for the closest monitoring area only 



## Research findings

### What worked well

In this round of research, we found:
* the daily air quality index (DAQI) forecast, 4 day forecast and the Met Office forecast are still understood
* the top level of health advice is understood
* the level of communication is appropriate for non-specialists 



### What needs work

During this round of testing, we found that:
* the graphs disrupt the flow of the overall messaging 
* the story and flow in particular what pollutants we monitor and why appears to be lost
* user desire to see stronger, positive recommendations for self-protection, action and behaviour change remains quite high 




## What we focused on in sprint 9

As a team in sprint nine, we agreed the main points to focus on were:  

* improving the health messaging based on feedback from the UKHSA
* prioritising statutory pollutants and messaging around air pollution to set the story
* using Rural-Urban classifications and historic data to dispel air pollution myths in a user's chosen area e.g. I live the countryside why do I need ot worry?
* displaying the last pubished annual means for each statutory pollutant for that given area  



### Health advice
