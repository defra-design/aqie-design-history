## Research goals from sprint 8

This research was conducted with a mix of participants living in the South West of England.

We focussed on testing: 
* a 24 hour view of historical local air pollutant levels
* using charts rather than a table to see if the visual approach worked better
* removing the tooltips for explaining elements of the charts and putting the content ‘inline’ instead
* displaying monitoring data for the closest monitoring area only 



## Research findings

### What worked well

In this round of research, we found:
* the daily air quality index (DAQI) forecast, 4 day forecast and the Met Office forecast are still understood
* the top level of health advice is understood
* the level of science communication is appropriate for non-specialist 



### What needs work

During this round of testing, we found that:
* the graphs disrupt the flow of taking in the overall messaging of the page
* people who engage with the graphs lose track of the overall page
* participants completely miss that there are statutory pollutants we need to monitor
* user desire to see stronger, positive recommendations for self-protection, action and behaviour change remains quite high 




## What we focused on in sprint 9

As a team in sprint nine, we agreed the main points to focus on were:  

* only showing the nearest monitoring area
* displaying a chart with the past 24 hours of pollutant data

### Only showing the nearest monitoring area

Due to the automatic urban and rural network (AURN) monitoring sites being spread widely across the country, it’s unusual for a user to have more than one relevant monitoring area nearby. Therefore, instead of displaying information for their nearest 3 monitoring areas, we only focused on their closest area.

### Displaying a chart with the past 24 hours of pollutant data

We wanted to start displaying some of the historical data that we have access to in a way that could help users understand the  pollutants monitored in their area better. This could help give context to the pollutants and potentially help users think about what may be causing them to rise or fall and therefore engage more with the concept of air quality. We chose to use a chart rather than a table as it is more visual. The chart design was adapted from the accessible charts that appear in the Flooding service.
