## Research goals from sprint 8

This research was conducted with a mix of participants living in the South West of England.

We focussed on testing: 
* a 24 hour view of historical local air pollutant levels
* using charts rather than a table to see if the visual approach worked better
* removing the tooltips that explaining elements of the tables and putting the content ‘inline’ instead
* displaying data for the closest monitoring area only 



## Research findings

### What worked well

In this round of research, we found:
* the daily air quality index (DAQI) forecast, 4 day forecast and the Met Office forecast are still understood
* the top level of health advice is understood
* the level of communication is appropriate for non-specialists 



### What needs work

During this round of testing, we found that:
* the graphs disrupt the flow of the overall messaging 
* participants completely miss that there are statutory pollutants we need to monitor
* user desire to see stronger, positive recommendations for self-protection, action and behaviour change remains quite high 




## What we focused on in sprint 9

As a team in sprint nine, we agreed the main points to focus on were:  

* only showing the nearest monitoring area
* displaying a chart with the past 24 hours of pollutant data

### Only showing the nearest monitoring area

Due to the distancing between many people and their 3 closest automatic urban and rural network (AURN) areas, we focused on their closest one.

### Displaying a chart with the past 24 hours of pollutant data

We wanted to start displaying some of the historical data that we have access to in a way that could help users understand the  pollutants monitored in their area better. Seeing the patterns of their air quality could help users think what may be causing them to rise or fall and therefore increase their engagement. We chose to use a chart rather than a table as it is more visual. The chart design was adapted from the accessible charts that appear in the Flooding service.
